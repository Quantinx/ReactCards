Based on the previous project where we constructed a memory card game using an API and localstorage.

To assist in learning how React logic and structure differs from JavaScript I attempted to port the project over.

Currently it mostly works how it did previously, however due to certain limitations and the more async nature of React, a few issues have cropped up.

This is by no means intended as a 1:1 port of the original, but as a learning experience
